   └── batch1: 365 samples (Liver Kupffer cells)

   PILOT7 (4,750 samples total - 13.31%):
   ├── batch1: 1,469 samples
   └── batch2: 3,281 samples
   ├── Spleen: 1,469 samples
   ├── LymphNode: 1,469 samples
   ├── Salivary: 727 samples
   ├── Tongue: 719 samples
   └── Blood: 366 samples

3. TECHNOLOGY VERIFICATION:
   - All 35,674 samples are Smart-seq2 technology
   - All file paths contain "smartseq2" directory
   - 27,664 samples have "SS2" in sample name (Pilot2-7)
   - 8,010 samples don't have "SS2" in name but are still Smart-seq2 (Pilot1)

4. FILE VALIDATION:
   - All R1 and R2 files exist and are accessible
   - File sizes range from ~5MB to ~1GB per read file
   - All samples have paired-end reads
   - All samples currently in "pending" status

5. SAMPLE NAMING CONVENTIONS:
   - Pilot1: B[number]_[position]_Blue_[tissue]_S[number] or B[number]_[position]_S[number]
   - Pilot2-7: TSP6_[tissue]_NA_SS2_[color]_[batch]_[celltype]_[position]_S[number]

6. TISSUE TYPES IDENTIFIED:
   - Liver (Pilot6): 365 samples
   - Blood (Pilot1): 368 samples  
   - ExocrinePancreas (Pilot1): 368 samples
   - Various other tissues from Pilot1-3,7

7. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
   Pilot1_fastqs/smartseq2/Tabula_Sapiens/ (736 samples)
   Pilot1_fastqs/smartseq2/pilot/ (7,274 samples)
   Pilot2_fastqs/smartseq2/batch1/ (7,646 samples)
   Pilot2_fastqs/smartseq2/batch2/ (7,659 samples)
   Pilot2_fastqs/smartseq2/batch3/ (6,876 samples)
   Pilot3_fastqs/smartseq2/batch1/ (368 samples)
   Pilot6_fastqs/smartseq2/batch1/ (365 samples)
   Pilot7_fastqs/smartseq2/batch1/ (1,469 samples)
   Pilot7_fastqs/smartseq2/batch2/ (3,281 samples)

8. DATA QUALITY CHECKS:
   ✅ No duplicate sample IDs
   ✅ No missing R1 files
   ✅ No missing R2 files
   ✅ No invalid file sizes
   ✅ All samples have consistent naming patterns
   ✅ All file paths are absolute and valid
   ✅ Proper batch organization maintained
   ✅ Pilot1 correctly divided into Tabula_Sapiens and pilot subdirectories

CONCLUSION:
===========
The manifest file is absolutely correct and contains exactly the Smart-seq2 technology samples needed. The file was produced correctly with:
- Complete sample coverage (35,674 samples)
- Valid file paths for all samples
- Consistent Smart-seq2 technology across all samples
- Proper paired-end read structure
- No data integrity issues

The number of samples (35,674) appears to be correct based on the comprehensive validation performed.
